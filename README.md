## About 42 && 1337 School :

This project is a programming bootcamp concerning 1337 school, it lasts roughly 
4 weeks, working 7 days a week, day and night. (error 404 sleep will never be found)
These bootcamp covers the basics of programming so there's no need to have any experience at
all. People will try and will fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error
process is necessary in order to find solutions to different problems that 
once thought impossible. People learn in groups with other
students, without teachers. It can be done, and it works.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills developed at 42cursus

### Hard-skills

	* C/C++ language, Makefile
	* Shell scripting
	* Git
	* Networks
	* Docker
	* SQL
	* Web (HTML, CSS, Wordpress)
	* Computer graphics
	* Assembly language

-- among others (find below the complete [curriculum](#-42s-galaxy-curriculum)).

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.

## üåå 42's galaxy (curriculum)

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.

The table below presents the cursus curriculum in the chronological order in which it was (or is to be) completed by me - projects order and corresponding attained level may vary among students.
