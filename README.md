## About 42 && 1337 School :

This project is a programming bootcamp concerning 1337 school, it lasts roughly 
4 weeks, working 7 days a week, day and night. (error 404 sleep will never be found)
These bootcamp covers the basics of programming so there's no need to have any experience at
all. People will try and will fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error
process is necessary in order to find solutions to different problems that 
once thought impossible. People learn in groups with other
students, without teachers. It can be done, and it works.
