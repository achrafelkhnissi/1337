### BONUS

## Extra 

- What is VirtualBox?
VirtualBox is designed to run virtual machines on your physical machine without reinstalling your OS that is running on a physical machine.

- What is a VM?
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that works like a computer inside of a computer. It will run on an isolated partition of its host computer with its own resources of CPU power, memory, an operating system, and other resources.

- What is UTM?
- What is a server?
- What is Debian?
- What is CentOS?
- What is KDump? (for CentOS)
- What is the difference between Debian and CentOS?
- What is SELinux? (for CentOS)
- What is AppArmor? (for Debian)
- What is LVM? (Logical Valume Manager) and what its uses?
	- Creating single logical valumes off multiple physical volumes or entire hard disks, allowing for dynamic volume resizing.
	- Managing large hard disk farms by allowing disks to be added and replaced iwhtout downtime or service disruption.
	- On small systems (like a desktop), instead of having to estimate at installation time how big a partition might need to be, LVM allows filesystems to be esily resized as needed.
	- Performing consistent backups by taking snapshots of the logical volumes.
	- Encrypting multiple physical partitions with one password.
	- In Linux, LVM is a device mapper framework that provides logical valume managment for the linux kernel.
	- https://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical\_Volume\_Manager\_(Linux)
- What is partitioning in Linux? (related to LVM)
	- Partitioning also allows you to divide your hard drive into isolated sections, where each section behaves as its own hard drive.
	- The idea is that if you have one hard disk, and want to have, say, two operating systems on it, you can divide the disk into two patitions. Each operating system uses its partition as it wishes and doesn't touch the other one. This way the two operating sysytems can co-exist peacefully on the same hard disk. Without partitions one would have to buy a hard disk for each operating sysytem.
	- Logical Partitions:
	- Extended Partitions:
	- Primary Partitions:
	- Sub-Partitions:
	- Each partition and extended partition has its own device file. The naming convention for these fles is that a partition's number is appended after the name of the whole disk, with the convention that 1-4 are primary partitions(regardless of how mamy primary partitions there are) and number greater than 5 are logical partitions (regardless of within which primary partition they reside). For example, `dev/hda1` is the first primary partition on the first IDE hard disk, and `/dev/sdb7` is the third extended partition on the second SCSI hard disk.
- What is a Device Mapper? (related to LVM)
	- The Device Mapper is a framework provided by the Linux Kernel for mapping  physical block dvices
	- You can view block devices informations with the lsblk command.
	- Block Devices:
	- Character Devices:
	- Using the `ls -l /dev/` command: The first character in the first column, i.e 'c', tells an informed user the type of the file, in this case a character device. For 'b' for block devices, 'd' for directories, '-' for ordinary files, 'l' for Symbolic link files (links on any regular files), 'p' Named pipe (a mechanism for interprocess communication), 's' for socket (used for interprocess communication).
- What is the differences between aptitude and apt?
- What is APPArmor?
- What is SSH?
- What is ports?
- What is UFW firewall?
- What is DNF? (to install UFW on CentOF)
- What is cron?
- In the network settings of the virtualbox! what is the difference between "NAT" and "Bridged Adapter"?

- What is WordPress?
- What is lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP?
- What is NGINX / Apache2? and what can i use as thier alternative?
- What is a signature.txt file?
- What is sha1 format?

Q: Why Debian?
A: It's easier to install and configure than CentOS (and i haven't use CentOS befoe)

Q: What is virtual machine?
A: Aâ€¯Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy
apps. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all
running on the same host. For example, you can run a virtual MacOS machine on a physical PC.

Q: What it's purpose?
A: VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run software that requires a different
operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment.

Q: How does it works?
A: VM working through "Virtualization" technology. Virtualization uses software to simulate virtual hardware that allows
VMs to run on a single host machine.

Q: Diff between aptitude and apt?
A: Aptitude is a high-level package manager while APT is lower-level package manager which can be used by other
higher-level package managers
(read more: https://www.tecmint.com/difference-between-apt-and-aptitude/)

Q: What is AppArmor?
A: AppArmor ("Application Armor") is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs'
capabilities with per-program profiles.
(read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor)

Q: What is SSH?
A: SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system
administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

I think this one need an addition to make it more easy to pass evaluation. So, here we are on our checklist and his commands.

How to change hostname?
[$sudo nano /etc/hostname]

Where is sudo logs in /var/log/sudo?
[$cd /var/log/sudo/00/00 && ls]
You will see a lot of directories with names like 01 2B 9S 4D etc. They contain the logs we need.
[$ sudo apt update]
[$ ls]
Now you see that we have a new directory here.
[$ cd <nameofnewdirectory> && ls]
[$ cat log] <- Input log
[$ cat ttyout] <- Output log

How to add and remove port 8080 in UFW?
[$ sudo ufw allow 8080] <- allow
[$ sudo ufw status] <- check
[$ sudo ufw deny 8080] <- deny (yes yes)

How to run script every 30 seconds?
[$ sudo crontab -e]
Remove or commit previous cron "schedule" and add next lines in crontab file
|*************************************************|
| */1 * * * * /path/to/monitoring.sh              |
| */1 * * * * sleep 30s && /path/to/monitoring.sh |
|*************************************************|
To stop script running on boot you just need to remove or commit
|********************************|
| @reboot /path/to/monitoring.sh |
|********************************|
line in crontab file.
