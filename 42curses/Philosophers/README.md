## Summary
In this  project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will learn how to make threads. You will discover the mutex.

## Overview
What you should understand to succeed this project:
- Once or more philosophers are sitting at a round table either eating, either thinking, either sleeping, While they are eating, they do not think or sleep; while thinking they don't eat or sleep; and, of course, while sleeping, they do not eat or think.
- The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
- There are some forks on the table. Serving and eating spaghetti with a simple fork is very inconvenient, so the philosophers will eat with two forks, one for each hand.
- Each time a philosopher finishes eating, they will drop their forks and start sleeping. Once they have finished sleeping, they will start thinking. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
- Every philosopher needs to eat and they should never starve.
- Philosophers don't speak with each other.
- Philosophers don't know when another philosopher is about to die.
- No need to say the philosophers should avoid dying!

## General Instructions
You have to write a program for the mandatory part and another on for the bonus part but they will have the same basic rules:
- Global variables are forbidden!
- The program should take the following arguments: `number_of_philosophers` `time_to_die` `time_to_eat` `time_to_sleep` `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`
	- `number_of_philosophers`: is the number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
	- `time_to_die`: is in milliseconds, if a philosopher doesn't start eating `time_to_die` milliseconds after starting their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, it dies.
	- `time_to_eat`: is in milliseconds and is the time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time they will need to keep the two forks.
	- `time_to_sleep`: is in milliseconds and is the time the philosopher will spend sleeping.
	- `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat`: argument is optional, if all philosophers eat at least `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat`the simulation will stop. If not specified, the simulation will stop only at the death of a philosopher.
- Each philosopher should be given a number from 1 to `number_of_philosophers`.
- Philosopher number 1 is next to philosopher number `number_of_philosophers`. Any other philosopher with the number `N` is seated between philosopher `N - 1` and philosopher `N + 1`.

About the logs of the program:

- Any change of status of a philosopher must be written as follows (with `X` replaced with the philosopher number and `timestamp_in_ms` the current timestamp in milliseconds):
```
	- timestamp_int_ms X has taken a fork
	- timestamp_int_ms X has is eating
	- timestamp_int_ms X has is sleeping 
	- timestamp_int_ms X has is thinking
	- timestamp_int_ms X has died
```
- The status printed should not be scrambled or intertwined with another philosopher's status.
- You can't have more than 10ms between the death of a philosopher and when it will print its death.
- Again, philosophers should avoid dying!

## Mandatory Part
The specific rules for the mandatory part are:
- Each philosopher should be a thread.
- One fork between each philosopher, therefore if they are multiple philosophers, there will be a fork at the right and the left of each philosopher.
- To avoid philosophers duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them.

## Bonus Part
For The bonus part, the program takes the same arguments as before and should behave as explained in the [General Instructions](#general-instructions). The specific rules are:
- All the forks are in the middle of the table.
- They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by a semaphore.
- Each philosopher should be a process and the main process should not be a philosopher.
