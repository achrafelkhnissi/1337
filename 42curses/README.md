## ðŸŒŒ 42's galaxy (curriculum)

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.

The table below presents the cursus curriculum in the chronological order in which it was (or is to be) completed by me - projects order and corresponding attained level may vary among students.
