## Project Information

### About

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using *UNIX signals*. \
Keep in mind:
- You have to handle errors sensitively. In no way can your program quit unexpectedly (Segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc).
- Your program cannot have memory leaks.
- You can use one global variable but it must be justified.

### Mandatory

- Produce `server` & `client` executables
- `client` must communicate a string passed as a parameter to `server` *(referenced by its process ID)* which then displays it
- Use `SIGUSR1` & `SIGUSR2` signals **ONLY**

### Bonus

- Add reception acknowledgement system
- Support Unicode characters

### Allowed Functions

### Intro to signals

Signals are standardized messages sent to a running program to trigger specific behavior, such as quitting or error handling. They are a limited form of inter-process communication (IPC), typically used in POSIX-compliant operating systems. \
When a signal is sent. the operating system interrupts the target process normal flow of executing to deliver the signal. Execution can be interrupted during any non-atomic instruction. If the process has previously registered a signal handler,  that routine is executed. Otherwise, the default signal handler is executed. \
A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action. \
A signal is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly. \
There are two types of signals:
- __Maskable__: signals which can be changed or ignored by the user (e.g., Ctrl+C)
- __None-Maskable__: Signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occurs when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors.

#### Handling signals
Signal handlers can be installed with the [`signal(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) or [`sigaction(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html) system calls. If a signal handler is not installer for a particular signal, the fefault handler is user. Otherwise the signal is intercepted and the signal handler is invoked.

The following is a list of all signals with names as in the include file `<signal.h>`:

### Notes
- getpid(): gets process ID
- SIGINT: its a signal that by default interrupt the process the tells it to end.
- signal(): takes two arguments, 1. process 2. pointer to a funtion. and execute the function rather than its default behavior! (as far as i know for now)
