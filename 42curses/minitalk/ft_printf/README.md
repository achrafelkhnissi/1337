## üó£Ô∏è About

> _This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future project without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments._

	üöÄ TLDR: this project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
	information below) of the printf function.

### Mandatory

* **format specifiers** - `cspdiuxX%`

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile the library, run:

```shell
$ cd path/to/ft_printf && make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the required flags:

```shell
-lftprintf -L path/to/libftprintf.a -I path/to/ft_printf.h
```

## Notes

1. What is Variadic Functions?
	- Variadic function takes indefinite size arity and a variable number of arguments as a parameter. Situations that you do not know how many parameters pass the function.
2. what is ellipses (...)?
	- The ellipsis (...) is part of the C language and indicates that there are 0 or more optional arguments.
2. What is va_list?
	-
3. What is va_start?
	- gets the address of the first argument.
4. What is va_arg?
	- dereference the block address and type cast it to the appropriate type. then goes to the next block of memory.
	- What is a "Type Descriptor"?
5. What is va_end?
