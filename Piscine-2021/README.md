## About 42 && 1337 School :

This project is a programming bootcamp concerning 1337 school, it lasts roughly 
4 weeks, working 7 days a week, day and night. (error 404 sleep will never be found)
These bootcamp covers the basics of programming so there's no need to have any experience at
all. People will try and will fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error
process is necessary in order to find solutions to different problems that 
once thought impossible. People learn in groups with other
students, without teachers. It can be done, and it works.

> If you're going through hell, keep going. ― Winston Churchill

## Requirements for this projet :

* Rigor .
* The will to learn .
* Simple manipulation of a mouse and keyboard .
* [Link for music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dVq6is4P8wXCWQwVZuOl0?si=eef52402e20748ac) to relief you .

## How to [compile](https://vitux.com/how-to-write-and-run-a-c-program-in-linux/)?

- We use `gcc` command with specific `flags`.
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) = Gnu Compiler Collection.
- Example:

```sh
$> gcc "filename.c" -o "executable.exe" -Wall -Wextra -Werror
```

#### What's happen when you invoke the C compiler?

```
Flags: To stop the compiler in a certain process..

	     -E			      -S	       -c
.c -------------------------> .. ------------> .s -------------> .o -----------> exec/bin.
	  preprocessor		   compiler	    assembler	       linker
    handle #include, #define	  translate C	   translate .s      *.o to exec
	strip comments..	  to Assembly	   to obj files	      aka: bin
```

-  Don't you dare to forget reading [manuals](https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-man-command/), read them religiously. ;)

## Divergent & Convergent Thinking

- One of the essential rules when you're trying to come up with ideas, is spend a certain amount of time, whatever it is, coming up with ideas, not judging them, not holding them back, and then separating that distinctly and deliberately from the process of taking that idea and evaluating it and doing something with it.

\* Double Diamond. (to search)

## Notes

- Data structures:
	- Stack: FILO
	- Queue: FIFO
* [Process vs Thread: What's the difference?](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)
* Abstraction is separating the implementation from your interface.
* My programming strategy:
	1. First you need to understand how you want your program to behave, and what output to expect.
	2. Start with coding the tests before starting to code the actual program.
	3. Separate your to program to smaller programs/functions and create each one of them. (make sure the first one works before going to the second.
	4. The final step is to test the result and start the debugging process if there is a bug.) 
* echo $?: display the exit code of the previously ran program.
* malloc and calloc functions returns a **void pointer**. Due to this reason, they can allocate a memory for any type of data.
* [Trick 4: Find a letter's positions in alphabet.](https://www.techiedelight.com/bit-hacks-part-4-playing-letters-english-alphabet/)
* [Swap casing letter using bitwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCCzpvN3vZE)
* [Strategies for finishing programming projects 10-times faster.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg1wZgCdJPA)
	1. You should be able to explain your strategy/code and know how it works and how it is supposed to work.
	2. Don't ever take code on faith: You should always understand every line of your code. If you have a piece of code that you don't understand.. do not proceed untill you understand what it does and how it works.
	3. RTFM. or (documentations).
	4. Solve all your mysteries: You wrote a code and you thought you knew what it did and it behaving mysteriously.
		- Don't try stuff randomly.
		- Don't move forward until u know why it behave that way. (or do your best)
	5. If you don't understand a bug, You are destined to repeat it.

## Minimal C kernel for Jupyter

### Use with Docker (recommended)

 * `docker pull brendanrius/jupyter-c-kernel`
 * `docker run -p 8888:8888 brendanrius/jupyter-c-kernel`
 * Copy the given URL containing the token, and browse to it. For instance:
 
 ```
 Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
 to login with a token:
    http://localhost:8888/?token=66750c80bd0788f6ba15760aadz53beb9a9fb4cf8ac15ce8
