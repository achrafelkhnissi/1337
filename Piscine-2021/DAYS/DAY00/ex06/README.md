## EXERCISE 06

* Now that you're LDAP expert, you are going to be able to add your phone number into the mobile field.
* Here's and LDIF file template:
```
dn: uid=pnom,ou=people,dc=42,dc=fr
changetype: modify
delete: pouette
```
* To check if your command has worked, try to look yourself up on LDAP!

HINTS:
1. Add your real number: your future teammates will be happy to know how to reach you!.
2. Don't hesitate to fill in other fields if you're up for it. However, you don√Ñt have all the permissions, we're not idiots ;)
3. You can change your address any time, via the 'email-address' field.
