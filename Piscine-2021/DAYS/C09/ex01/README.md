# Exercise 01: Makefile
- Create the `Makefile` that’ll compile a library `libft.a`.
- Your `makefile` should print all the command it’s running.
- Your `makefile` should not run any unnecessary command.
- The `Makefile` will get its source files from the "srcs" directory.
- Those files will be: `ft_putchar.c`, `ft_swap.c`, `ft_putstr.c`, `ft_strlen.c`, `ft_strcmp.c`
- The `Makefile` will get its header files from the "includes" directory.
- Those files will be: `ft.h`
- It should compile the .c files with gcc and with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` flags in that order.
- The lib should be at the root of the exercise.
- `.o` files should be near their `.c` file.
- The `Makefile `should also implement the following rules: `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, `all` and of course `libft.a`.
- Running just `make` should be equal to `make all`
- The rule `all` should be equal to `make libft.a`.
- The rule `clean` should remove all the temporary generated files.
- The rule `fclean` should be like a `make clean` plus all the binary made with `make all`.
- The rule `re` should be like a `make fclean` followed by `make all`.
- Your `makefile` should not compile any file for nothing.
- We’ll only fetch your `Makefile` and test it with our files.
- NOTE!: Watch out for whildcards!
