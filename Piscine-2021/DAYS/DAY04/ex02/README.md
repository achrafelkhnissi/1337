## Exercise 02: ft_iterative_power
- Create an iterated function that returns the value of a power applied to a number. An power lower than 0 returns 0. Overflows don't have to be handled.
- Here's how it should be prototyped:
```C
int	ft_iterative_power(int nb, int power);
```

## Understanding Power (exponent)
- The power (exponent) of a number says how many times to use the number in a multiplication.
- In **8^2** the "2" says to use 8 twice in a multiplication, so `8^2 = 8 * 8 = 64`
- Exponents are also called Power or Indices.

### In General
- **a^n** tells you to multiply **a** by itself, so there are **n** of those **a**'s:
