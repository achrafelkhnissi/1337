## Exercise 03: hexdump

- Create a "program" called `ft_hexdump` which does the same thing as the system's `hexdump` command-line.
- The only option you have to handle is `-C`
- The submission directory should have a `Makefile` with the following rules: `all`, `clean`, `fclean`
- You may use the variable `errno`


## Notes.

- man last, utmp, wtmp, lastlog.
- .asl files = apple system log.
