## Notes

### Replacement command: substitution
```
sed 's/search-pattern/replecement-string/flags'
```
- the flag `-i` stands for in place editing (to save the changes to the file).
- Sed goes through each lines at a time and change the first occurrence of the matching pattern with the replacement.
- It is optional to add flags
- Idk if you can add more than 1 flag and how (yet)
- By default, only the first occurrence of the matching pattern in the current line gonna get replaced, to change that you need to add the flag `g` for global.
- [Error: extra characters at the end of l command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35620009/sed-extra-characters-at-end-of-l-command)
- Instead of forward slash `/` you can use any symbol by using it like this: `s#pattern#replacement`


### Delete command: d
```
sed '/This/d' filename.txt
# delete all the lines that contains the word 'This'
```
- To use multiple commands or multiple sed expressions we use `;` `sed '/^#/d ; /^$/d' filename.txt` or use the `-e` option.
