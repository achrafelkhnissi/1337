# Exercise 07: r_dwssap

- Write a command line that displays the output of a cat /etc/passwd command, removing comments, every other line starting from the second line, reversing each lo- gin, sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and keeping only logins between FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2 included, and they must separated by ", " (without quotation marks), and the output must end with a ".".

- Example: Between lines 8 and 16, the result should be something like this:
```
$> ./r_dwssap.sh
sstq_, sorebrek_brk_, soibten_, sergtsop_, scodved_, rlaxcm_, rgmecived_, revreswodniw_, revressta_
.$>
```

HINT: Rigorously follow the order indicated in the instructions.
