## Exercise 04: ft_split_whitespaces
- Create a function that splits a string of characters into words.
- Separators are spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
- This function returns an array where each box contains a character-string's address represented by a word. The last element of this array should be equal to 0 to emphasise the end of the array.
- There can't be any empty strings in your array. Draw the necessary conclusions.
- The given string can't be modified.
- Here's how it should be prototyped:
```C
	char	**ft_split_whitespaces(char *str);
```
- Allowed functions: __malloc__
