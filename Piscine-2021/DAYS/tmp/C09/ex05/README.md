## Exercise 05: ft_list_push_params

- Create the function `ft_list_push_params` which creates a new list that includes command-line arguments.
- The first argument should be at the end of the list.
- The first link's address n the list is returned.
- Here's how it should be prototyped:
```c
t_list	*ft_list_push_params(int ac, char **av);
```
