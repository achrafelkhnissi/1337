## Exercise 14: ft_list_sort

- Create the function `ft_list_sort` which sorts the list's contents by ascending order by comparing two links thanks to a function that can compare the data held in those two links.
- Here's how it should be prototyped:
```c
void	ft_list_sort(t_list **begin_list, int (*cmp)());
```
