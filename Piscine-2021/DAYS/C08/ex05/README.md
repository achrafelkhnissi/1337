## Exercise 05: ft_show_tab
- Create a function that displays the content of the array created by the previous function.
- Here's how it should be prototyped:
```C
void	ft_show_tab(struct s_stock_par *par);
```
- The structure will be the same as the previous exercise and will be defined in the __ft_stock_str.h__ file.
- For each box, we'll display:
	- the string followed by '\n' 
	- the size followed by '\n'
	- the copy of the string (that could have been modified) followed by '\n'
