## Exercise 05: ft_sqrt
- Create a function that returns the square root of a number (if it exists), or 0 if the square root is an irrational number.
- Here's how it should be prototyped:
```C
int	ft_sqrt(int nb);
```

## Understanding Squares and Square Roots
### Squares
- To square a number: multiply it by itself.

- Squares From 0^2 to 6^2

| | | | | |||      
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|0 Square |=| 0^2 |=| 0 * 0 |=| 0
|1 Square |=| 1^2 |=| 1 * 1 |=| 1
|2 Square |=| 2^2 |=| 2 * 2 |=| 4 
|3 Square |=| 3^2 |=| 3 * 3 |=| 9 
|4 Square |=| 4^2 |=| 4 * 4 |=| 16 
|5 Square |=| 5^2 |=| 5 * 5 |=| 25
|6 Square |=| 6^2 |=| 6 * 6 |=| 36

- The squares are also on the [Multiplication - Times Tables](https://www.mathsisfun.com/tables.html).

### Negative Numbers
- We can also square **negative numbers**.
- Example: What happens when we square (-5)?
- Answer: (-5) * (-5) = 25. (Because [Multiplying Negatives Makes A Positive](https://www.mathsisfun.com/multiplying-negatives.html)).
- When a square is **negative** number we get a positive result, just the same as squaring positive numbers.

### Square Roots
- A **square root** goes the other way: 3 squared is 9, so square root of 9 is 3.

- A square root of a number is a value that can be multiplied by itself to give the original number. It is like asking: What can we multiply by itself to get this?
