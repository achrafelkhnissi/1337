## Exercise 00: libft
- Create your __ft__ library. It'll be called __libft.a__.
- A shell script called __libft_creator.sh__ will compile source files appropriately and will create your library.
- This library should contain __all__ of the following functions:
```C
void	ft_putchar(char c);
void	ft_swap(int *a, int *b);
void	ft_putstr(char *str);
int	ft_strlen(char *str);
int	ft_strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
```
- We'll launch the following command-line:
```sh
sh libft_creator.sh
```
- Allowed functions: __write__
- Hint: Don't hesitate to add other useful functions... ;-)
