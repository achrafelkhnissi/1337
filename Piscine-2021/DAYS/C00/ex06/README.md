## EXERCISE 06
* Create a function that displays all different combinations of two digits between 00 and 99, listed by ascending order.
* Here's the expected output:
```
$>./a.out | cat -e
00 01, 00 02, 00 03, 00 04, 00 05, ..., 00 99, 01 02, ..., 97 99, 98 99$>
```
* Here's how it should be prototyped:
```C
void	ft_print_comb2(void);
```
+ Files to turn in: ft_print_comb2.c
+ Allowed functions: ft_putchar
